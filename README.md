**Project Name:** Sorting Algorithms

**Objective:** An application that allows the user to input an array and sorts that array using different sorting algorithms

**Reflection
what are the learning goals: **

1. Gave me an insight on the different ways an array can be sorted along with the time taken among these algorithms
2. refreshed my javascript and html skills

**Obstacles I came across:**

1. To understand the sorting algorithms, I needed to watch youtube videos
2. small errors occurred such as the validate function not working

**Tools used to implement this project:**

HTML, CSS: for front end development
Javascript: for programming the algorithms to sort the data
